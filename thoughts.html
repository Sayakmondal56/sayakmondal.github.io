    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
    <p>Here, I share my ideas on various topics, including technology, efficiency, and personal growth.</p>

    <h2>AI and Efficiency</h2>
    <p>I believe AI can streamline inefficiencies in sectors like hiring and education. For example, automating tailored resumes can reduce friction for job seekers and employers.</p>

    <h2>Circular Coordination</h2>
    <p>My vision is to create a network where companies benefit from each other’s strengths, eliminating outdated practices and driving systemic change.</p>

    <h2>Overcoming Barriers</h2>
    <p>Coming from a rural village in India, I’ve faced significant barriers: limited networks, resources, and trust have often stood in my way.</p>

    <h2>Rejecting Traditional Paths</h2>
    <p>I reject traditional paths like college because I know what I want to do: optimize existing systems rather than reinvent them.</p>

    <h2>The O-1 Visa and My Goals</h2>
    <p>The O-1 Visa isn’t just a personal milestone; it’s a gateway to turning my bold ideas into reality.</p>
